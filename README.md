Ideate on possible ways to monetize B2C AI solutions.

#### Task instructions

We want you to think of ways B2C AI solutions will be monetized in the future. For example, in the late 90s, search engines were a hot upcoming technology that allowed people to navigate the web effortlessly. There were multiple business models identified at the time varying in revenue generation capability and mass adoption. Finally, Search powered by targetted advertisement arose as the most suitable commercialization method for this technology.
